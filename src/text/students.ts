      "From the rugged, breathtaking fjords of northern Norway in a town called Narvik, Erlend came to life and was born with the entrepreneurial spirit running through his veins. From the moment he could walk he started building products which could benefit mankind, yet his materials was limited to sticks and legos. He delved into finance and started lending money with interest to his sisters from his piggy bank. They never paid the interest, but he learned a valuable lesson about choosing the right customer.\n\nAs a child, his interest for art and science was blooming and he sought to challenge himself at the piano, holding concerts and embracing the adrenaline before performing and the sweet sensation of accomplishment afterwards. He sought this feeling in more than just music, and wanted to challenge himself, but how could he recreate it? His constant hunger for exciting adventures led him to areas such as climbing, skiing and videogames. Later on, he started creating digital worlds and learned about hacking. He expanded upon this knowledge and his hunger for building things skyrocketed. He saw similarities with playing piano and the idea of building companies and embraced entrepreneurship as an art form. \n\nLater, he worked as a web developer while studying cyber security, eventually adding data science and AI to his academic buffet. One day, he pitched a software product to a company. To his surprise, they didn't just laugh him out of the room. Instead, they let him build a few MVPs, so he quickly assembled a team and started hustling. Now, at the School of Entrepreneurship, Erlend is ready to tackle new challenges and ready to embrace the wildest of ideas.",

At the same time, she was always obsessed with the “why”, from a very young age, exploring possibilities everywhere. Because of this Hedda developed a gut feeling that she one day would do great things. This was a feeling she couldn´t shake, making her rethink the vision of her future. \n\nDuring the Covid pandemic Hedda decided to roll up her sleeves and attended the B.Sc. nursing. This kept her occupied for three years, before she once again started doubting her decisions and kept wanting more. She knew she had a greater potential and began investigating the huge innovative environment at NTNU Trondheim all by herself. It wasn´t before long something clicked inside her, and she realized what she had been missing all along – a community of entrepreneurs and innovators such as herself.\n\nHedda attended various events and competitions hosted by student organizations at NTNU, and half a year later she became the first ever intern of Naya; a startup from NTNU School of Entrepreneurship. During her internship at Naya, the entrepreneurial fire inside Hedda kept burning brighter. She became determent to attend NTNU School of Entrepreneurship, whatever it may take. \n\nNow, fulfilling her destiny, Hedda is shining brighter than ever.

Instead, he chose to study a bachelor's degree in entrepreneurship at BI to follow his passion for innovation and creation. From a bachelor's to a master's in entrepreneurship - one could say that Rolf now knows what he wants to do.\n\nRolf's journey has been a continuous process of learning and self-development, where he constantly takes on new challenges. This is someone who rarely says no. He loves learning new things, being creative, and even more: coffee breaks. This fine specimen is also the type that hates giving up. He’s without a doubt a perfectionist in his work, and although this might occasionally be at the expense of time, he always strives to achieve a result he can be proud of. Among friends and family, he is known for being a source of comfort, a mood booster, and someone you can always ask for help. Among others, he is known for a big butt, a bad hairline, and a passion for fashion.",

From a young age, she embraced stepping into uncomfortable situations, knowing that growth comes from tackling the unfamiliar.

This experience boosted her confidence and independence.\n\nAfter high school, she traveled for six months, hoping to find direction for her studies. Though it didn’t lead to immediate clarity, her love for buildings and math ultimately inspired her to pursue civil engineering at NTNU, a decision she’s never regretted. The degree has challenged her academically and deepened her interest in the construction industry, reinforced by a summer internship with Skanska in 2024.\n\nWhile in Trondheim, Aleksandra became actively involved in student life, joining organizations like UKA, ISFiT, and Studentersamfundet. These experiences allowed her to connect with new people and contribute to larger causes, which she finds highly motivating.\n\nDuring the pandemic, with social opportunities limited, Aleksandra turned to social media for creative expression. She began sharing her daily life on TikTok, which resonated with a growing audience. Today, she has over 500,000 followers on TikTok and Instagram combined, leading to exciting opportunities such as hosting the Abelia award for ""Norway\'s 50 Leading Tech Women"" and various commercial collaborations.\n\nNow, Aleksandra is ready to embark on a new challenge: entrepreneurship.

      "Hailing from a small place outside the coastal town of Risør, Hanna grew up with closeness to the ocean. Her childhood home’s proximity to the sea, as well as its surrounding forests, sparked her curiosity about the workings of life itself. The same kind of curiosity was also reflected in a general urge to learn about the world we live in. At the age of 17, this led Hanna to move to Canada to attend United World College of the Pacific, an international boarding school where students coming from a multitude of countries, cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds live and learn together for two years. This experience opened Hanna’s eyes to how similar we all are, despite the diversity of cultures and privileges we’re all born into.Upon returning to Norway, Hanna spent a year hiking and trekking in the Arctic of Norway. At a skiing trip around Svalbard (including a safe distance meet with a mama polar bear with two very cute cubs!), she realized she wanted to know more about nature. Thus, Trondheim and NTNU entered the picture, and so did a bachelor’s degree in biology. For a while, her plan was to continue on this path – but a course in entrepreneurship made her change paths. Hanna is fascinated with how combining an entrepreneurial mindset with an ecologist’s awareness can make the world a better place.",

Kajsa is good at having several thoughts in her head at the same time and can look at situations from different perspectives. Her ability to understand other people and be curious about their lives comes from traveling around the world. Kajsa is not afraid to ask the “dumb” questions no one else in the group dare to ask like “can someone tell me what are we actually doing now?”In search of new challenges, Kajsa moved to Halmstad in Sweden. There she attended a three year program to learn about interaction design. While studying there she met many new friends and worked with fun projects and companies. She left Halmstad with a bachelor degree in Informatics and with a broader perspective on design. But the story does not end there, she wanted to develop her skills even more. “Towards new adventures!” she said when she left Sweden, and now check where she is!",

Competing in one of the most competitive sports in Norway meant handling ups and downs on a regular basis, which he thinks is a great experience to have whenattending NSE.

Using the skills learned at school, he started making and selling custom made carbon cycling shoes for his friends as a side project. Seeing other people using his cycling shoes gave him great satisfaction, and the dream of starting a successful business was created. Since the day only has 24 hours, a decision had to be made about whether he should still pursue the dream of becoming the best skier in the world, or to become something big in the “real world”. As the student-life seemed the more enjoyable option, NSE and a future as an Entrepreneur now has become the new target.

Viktor grew up in Bergen, Norway, and started his entrepreneurial career at 8, selling trinkets and baubles on the streets of his neighbourhood. When he went to the UK to attend the UWC Atlantic College high school he continued this hobby by importing Norwegian Freia chocolate and selling it for a hefty markup price to some of the wealthy students. Later at NTNU, Viktor began studying applied and theoretical physics at the FYSMAT study program. When he got the chance to attend NTNU’s School of Entrepreneurship he leapt at the opportunity to become a better business developer and switched his field of study. It was one of the best decisions he ever made.",

The app was number one in the sports category in Norway! He jumped out of bed realizing he needed to study informatics so he could learn more than from just watching YouTube videos. Being number four on the waiting list to informatics, Andreas got on the train to Trondheim thinking he could talk his way into a spot at the Bachelor’s program. It didn’t work. With nowhere to go he was standing in front of Hovedbygningen at NTNU Gløshaugen thinking: “What am I going to do now?” He somehow knew he had to stay in Trondheim, walking down towards the pier, where BI was located. “Hey, can I start here tomorrow?”, he asked. After taking economics courses for a year, he finally started his informatics studies, finding UKA and the startup community along the way. Always having wanted to start his own business, NSE became a motivating challenge after finishing the Bachelor’s degree. Andreas loves to work with technology to help people in their everyday lives. When he is not in front of the computer he likes climbing, skiing and the occasional DJ-gig.",

However, she eventually found out that it was sufficient enough to finish one master degree so she had time to live her normal life. And what is a normal life for her? That would be to have three part-time jobs, being active in student organizations, having different leadership and board positions – as well as spend time with her friends and family over one of her home-cooked meals paired with some good wine. She is known for being a hard-working, busy and ambitious girl, but she is also determined to enjoy life to the fullest and have time for her wide sets of interests, like hunting, cooking or being active outdoors or in the gym. In other words, work-life balance is key. She knew from a young age that she wanted to work with technology and her desire to create something new came from her creative abilities. Her interest for entrepreneurship grew after working in a couple of startups, and she applied for NSE hoping to learn a lot and challenge herself.",

      "While studying for a M.Sc in Industrial Economics and Technology Management (Indøk), Vidar has dedicated himself to many extra-curricular activities; mainly in the volunteer student organization Start NTNU. Having served as project manager, mentor and head of the organization, he has gained tangible experience in leadership, public speaking, sales and management. Of further experience Vidar has served in the Norwegian army as a military police dog handler, and studied one year in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Vidar is energetic, action oriented and engaging. His passion lies in working with open minded, creative and hard working people; people that risk looking foolish by taking on challenges outside their comfort zones, and that don’t go home until the job is done. In addition to being interested in paragliding, music, basketball and psychology, he has a strong interest in technology and innovation, especially related to aquaculture. With both of his parents in the fish farming industry, Vidar has not only had his share of salmon for dinner, but also worked many summers as a fish farmer. What do fish farmers do, you might be wondering. Well – practically speaking – they tie endless amounts of rope, maneuver boats, and lift heavy things with big cranes; all while having cold seawater splashed in their face. Sounds fun, doesn’t it? Vidar thinks so too. His dream is to gather great people and build a business providing sustainable technological solutions for the aquaculture industry.",

An Eritrean woman, she was born and raised in Saudi Arabia before moving to Norway’s hidden gem Ulsteinvik at the age of 10. She likes to think she’s the world’s most confused passport holder. Besides her 4 languages, you’ve never met someone who switches between to or more languages so often. For a school competition, Reem made a small light circuit using batteries and a switch with her dad when she was 8. Just like that, she was hooked on everything powered. After learning that only 30% of women got leadership positions in secondary school, Reem decided it had to change. At high school, Reem was the only girl in a class of 30 boys with a goal to become an electrician and start her own business. After a few short circuits, she passed her trade certifications and started her bachelor’s degree at NTNU. As a student at NTNU, she was involved in different student organizations, parties, and part-time jobs to fund it all.

      "When Amanda was 6 years old, she asked her father, “dad, what’s the meanest word you know”. He answered, “that word is written in such ugly letters that you don’t learn them at school”. A couple of days later, Amanda came back to her father. “Dad, I asked my teacher. Such ugly letters don’t exist”. Born and raised in Oslo, she has always been driven by curiosity. An extreme eager to learn about and explore the world around her. Amanda takes on every opportunity she gets in the seeking of ideas and thoughts that can challenge her view on life. She is never frightened by new challenges. Her attitude has always been: “if not me, who?”. This impulsivity makes her hard to keep track of for friends and family.After finishing high-school, Amanda moved to Paris for a year. After learning the French language, exploring the culture, and sucking in all the impressions, she moved to Trondheim to pursue her dream of becoming a problem-solver. Namely, an engineer. After 3 years of studying Industrial Economics and Technology Management, she realized that her dream job didn’t exist. The dream job was something she had to create herself. Thus, applying to NSE was a no-brainer. Like all her friends and family, Amanda is eager to find out what challenges lie ahead of her.",

She has always loved to challenge the established and has by that given her father a lot of grey hairs over the years. She has a huge competitive spirit and has occasionally gotten herself a few enemies caused by playing board games. Anna lives by the rule of not taking life too seriously and is a firm believer that you can achieve anything you set your mind to. As Ole Ivars says: “You should be as you are, when you didn’t become as you should”. Before studying, Anna competed successfully on an international level in showjumping for many years. To keep her in the game, she invested heavily in an up-and-coming star two and a half years ago. “Kråka” has so far been an investment largely in red, but hopefully it will pay in a longer timeframe (sponsorship available). Before ES, Anna studied a bachelor’s degree in Political Science, mainly because she wanted to polish her debating skills, but also because she is determined to understand every decision made in history. On NSE and in life more generally, Anna is a positive woman who loves to be around people, spreading joy and laughter to everyone surrounding her. Anna went into the field of entrepreneurship because she wants to contribute to making a change for others and become as good of a businesswoman as Trond is.",

She lives by the motto “organization is the key” and faces life with a healthy dose of irony. In good Berlin fashion, she appreciates directness and – by now – also her more pessimistic side, which allows her to ask challenging questions. In her free time, volleyball rules her calendar, teaches her a great deal about team spirit, and takes her to different places around the country. In the summer, however, she likes to travel these places by bike and dreams of one day riding from Berlin to the North Cape. Craftsmanship runs in Hannah’s family, and she herself trained as a custom tailor after finishing school. The apprenticeship not only sharpened her sense of precision and determination but also taught her the darker side of the fashion industry. Although she had found her passion, rationality called and she moved to Berlin to study industrial engineering. Luckily, she was able to maintain her connection to the fashion industry during her bachelor’s degree. Along the way, she volunteered at a student-run consultancy and tried to learn a new language. In her master’s studies at TU Berlin and now NSE, she focuses on innovation, entrepreneurship, and sustainability – open to where her journey will take her, but eager to find more sustainable solutions for the (fashion) world.",

One of the many hobbies he had was to write code that would enhance the players power in video games. He wanted to follow his curiosity and therefore pursued a Bsc in Data Engineering. During his bachelors, Yrian managed to be ranked the number one salesman of games and gaming consoles in the region. In addition, Yrian and a group of friends developed a software accounting tool designed to help small and medium-sized businesses for a client. Like before, Yrian wanted to follow his curiosity and went to study business and entrepreneurship ‘’down under’’ at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University where he ranked the best of all students in Applied Entrepreneurship. Following the same pattern, Yrian wanted to see how far his curiosity could take him and is now studying a Msc in Civil Engineering at NSE",

While the other kids were busy trading football cards, he started work as a door to door salesman, earning royalties from his sales. Within a few weeks he had built an empire, having ten people working for him around the clock. His newfound interest in business resulted in him starting his first company the week of his 18th birthday. His love for structures lead him to Trondheim, where he got his BSc in Mechanical Engineering at NTNU. Still, he knew something was missing. Finally, he realized something he had known his whole life. He was going to be an entrepreneur. This collected focus led him back to Trondheim. That fall he was able to find a team, start a company and get the company’s first paying customer. One month later, they had an office in the Gründerbrakka incubator. When Anders is not working on his many projects he likes to travel, hike, ski, scuba dive or practice martial arts. His love and care for the nature around him impacts what he wants to accomplish. At NSE, he is now looking to hone his skills, so he can make an impact on the world around him",

The projects and people who trigger her motivation are given a new dimension of energy and dedication. She always finds ways forward when there is a tight spot and never prioritizes sleep when time is limited. That being said, she rarely hit the brakes and can occasionally be on her way to the moon. It is therefore in her best interest to sometimes take a reality check (read: ask some critical questions). Celine has an eagerness to succeed in something she is passionate about. Besides her main passion in sports, nature and sustainability, she tends to find new, weird passions she devotes all her time to.

      "It began with airplane food (think stale bread and butter pudding) and a bubbly human moving across continents at the age of 12 from little Norway en route America. Little did Isabella know this would be the start of her greatest journey yet – connecting with individuals all over the world. Her dream ever since has been to impact as many people as possible to use all their resources to make the best out of any situation. Brought up as a third culture kid (and still unsure where she is really from), having lived in more than five countries, Isabella was exposed to diverse environments from an early age. This is how she found a stimulus to understand the essence of communication and pursued a BSc. in International Communications and Media at Erasmus University in the Netherlands. She found her communication skills applicable by day in a startup and by night she rowed through the canals with her Dutch girlfriends. This was followed by a foundation year in Television Journalism at NLA Media University College Gimlekollen – this is when Isabella learned she was scared of being on camera, but loved the show behind-the-scenes. So, she fled the country (again) and started working for an international PR agency in Berlin before she fell face forward with the startup world. She ended up spending 2.5 years working for a fintech startup supporting the global communication activities of the brand before she realised it was more exciting finding out how the business grew and not only writing about it. She decided to call it quits and jump into the Grunderskolen programme at the University of Oslo before she landed back in the homeland to be a part of the ES program. This is when Isabella and Entrepreneurship found each other and the rest is history. Those who know Isabella, quote that she has been dead-set on staying connected with her friends, family and influencers aka role models (yes, she likes to talk to everyone) ever since they can remember – from the good old MySpace days, blogging platforms to the launch of the IG stories. Social media is and always will be Isabella’s go-to-tool not solely to cultivate relationships, but to maintain a connection throughout her on-going journey, no matter where she is based. The meaning of human connection was and always will be an important part of her identity. In fact, it is those ‘culture shock’ experiences that have taught Isabella her most important assets: how to thrive (read communicate) in diverse situations, connect with others and adapt to new environments quickly.",

He therefore attended the Norwegian University of Life Sciences where he achieved a bachelor in business administration.

Beside attending school and working in student organizations, he also made music and worked as a DJ. Racking up a couple of million plays online, he knew he could make an impact in the music industry so he applied for NSE to do so, and to make an impact on people.

Knowing the power of a diverse and industrious group of people was also an important aspect for applying to NSE. This Eirik learnt at UWC in Mostar where he met some great people who taught him to value what he would later recognize in the student body at NSE. A driven student body with a lot of curiosity and enthusiasm. After having lived a bit here, and studying a bit there, Eirik likes to discover new interests.

Her interest in partying and music took her to Klubbstyret at Samfundet for 3 years organizing concerts and everything backstage, event marketing, PR and more,  Her interest for project management and teamwork took her to “Boost Henne” (former “Kvinneprosjektet”), as the events project manager. Her interest in sustainable businesses got Live to work for Loopfront, the hotter than hot software company making solutions for recycling and reuse of building materials and inventory. All of this inspired Live to do her master at Entreprenørskolen, as a part of her 5 year Enginering and ICT Civil Engineer studies. A good choice! All the interesting subjects and inspiring people here! All the skills we are developing together! Great fun! Note: If you want to go randonnée skiing, go for a light jog, play tennis or go kayaking, please ask her to join!",

He finds communication and human behavior specifically interesting, and also has an interest in creating content in the field of photography and videography.Marcus is a yes-man, resulting in a schedule that’s always full. A full schedule is like fuel for Marcus, giving him energy and motivation to achieve more. In 2019 he turned his hobby for photography and videography into a paying job in his own company. He also challenged himself by taking on the role as a project manager in a marketing team, had lectures on topics of his interests, and kept stepping outside of his comfort zone the following years.Stepping out of his comfort zone has been a key factor for Marcus in learning, growing and developing new skills. He hopes to see himself as the CMO at his own startup someday soon.",

After high school she felt adventurous and decided to take a year off to join the Snow-Kite-Surf program at Hurdal Verk Folk High School. This year uncovered new sides of herself that she did not know she possessed. Her determination and positive attitude could take her to new heights – literally.

      "Some say that “a jack of all trades is a master of none” was taylormade to describe Fredrik. Juggling his way through life, Fredrik sometimes finds himself googling “how to create more hours in a 24 hour day”. The best answer is to redefine an hour from 1/24 to 1/32 of a day. Before Fredrik really learned how to juggle, he had a big love for sports and competed on a professional level in ice hockey. The love for the sport led him to actually believe that expressions like “heart outside your jersey” and “brain outside your helmet” is applicable to everyday situations. To substantiate the “jack of all trades” quote, Fredrik holds a two-year equvialent in Finance, a one-year equivalent in International Relations, and a four-year equivalent in Civil Engineering. Fredrik possesses one exceptional skill: The skill of completely ignoring the fact that he is a student. To summarize some of them in chronological sequence:– Started a sock subscription startup at the age of 19. The story fits the fuckup night category. Sold a ton (literally) of socks in one day.– Brought together a team of ten students to create the largest innovation conference in Norway. In twelve months they managed to make their dream a reality.– Joined a tech-startup. Moved to Equinor’s HQs and joined the recognized accelerator Techstars Energy. Accelerator Puts Energy Entrepreneurs On The Road To Success – Forbes said. Backbreaking work: two years of work in three months – Finansavisen said. On the other hand, each and every professor Fredrik had said: Hi Fredrik. You still have not shown up in class – do you intend to take this subject? Fredrik believes that the nature of being an entrepreneur means that you fully embrace ambiguity and are comfortable with being challenged regularly – which made NSE a natural choice.",

He studied a lot and has lived and worked in different countries to gain as much experience for his corporate career as possible. But, there has always been this urge, this little voice in the back of his head… After having founded his first company with success but without passion, he realized that he should give more room to the one topic he couldn’t stop thinking about, motorcycles. Today, Joshua builds custom motorcycles, writes a blog about it, and runs a YouTube channel.

Even though none of them worked at all, he had loads of fun creating them. He already knew he would become an engineer of some sort when he grew up. An obsession with music technology steered his interest towards electronics and tried to solder together an electric guitar. Like the soap box carts, it also did not work at all. He then decided he had to take his engineering skills to the next level. He went on to study electrical engineering at NTNU. Meanwhile he volunteered as a video technician at Studentersamfundet and he eventually got a job at Nordic Semiconductor where he got to combine his love for electronics, programming, and music.

      "Yanislav is like an onion – although not traditionally pretty on the outside, he is a staple of every good recipe. Growing up in sunny Bulgaria, Yanislav saw his father taking on a plethora of jobs to support his family – working as a chef, deep-sea diver, fisherman, baker, builder, elevation worker, and business owner. This entrepreneurial spirit led to the family living a LEAN methodology lifestyle and move often. Hearing about Norwegian delicatesses like goat cheese and sour cream waffles, Yanislav’s family migrated to Norway in 2010, thus bringing Bulgarians to Scandinavia for the first time in recorded history. Yanislav obtained his BSc in Computer Engineering at Oslo Metropolitan University in 2019 and has kept busy during and after his degree – taking on roles in teaching, programming, IT support, and cybersecurity. After working and learning from experienced developers and project managers, Yanislav is looking for his next challenge – making new connections with people and continuing to learn and build.

Anna holds a bachelor’s degree in business and administration, and three semesters of legal studies. During her time as a student she did a lot of volunteer work as a photographer, creator and editor. Anna is determined; she did for example work out her own exchange agreement in Italy when the existing options did not suit her. Anna has too many interests, and too little time to keep up with them all. She dislikes waiting and is always on time. As her brother says; she is a woman of efficiency. Anna has a huge need for creating things and she gets restless and uneasy when she doesn’t have any creative outlets. Parallel with her increasing interest for the global climate crisis she has found her perfect hobby; redesigning furniture and clothes. Anna loves going to second hand stores to find new potential in old treasures.",

      "Jonas started his first job at age 12 selling newspapers, then working at the local pizza-bakery, then at the local gas station, before figuring out he could make quite a decent living importing and selling PlayStation-consoles from the US. It was at this point he discovered his knack for sales, moving on to outperform 40 sales-consultants as he claimed 6 salesman-of-the-month awards while working part-time after high-school. However, after coming to terms with the fact that sales were, in fact, nothing like The Wolf of Wall Street, he put his sales-career at ease and decided to pursue a master’s degree in – of all things – Industrial Design at NTNU. Here, he fell in love with StartNTNU where he was engaged as a project manager, and in spite of other contributions is perhaps best known as the “guy who brought a fu**** llama to campus”. Completely ignoring the fact that he was a student, Jonas also became involved in the tech-startup FlowMotion while simultaneously gaining experience as a student consultant for Junior Consulting (JrC). Jonas also became skilled at applying design methodology to other use cases and is specialized in UX- and UI-design, and is interested in the point where design meets management consulting. This methodology gained his trust as CEO for JrC throughout the academic year 19/20. Not one to turn down a challenge, Jonas did the first part of his exchange at Harvard Summer School followed by a year at PUC in Chile. Here, he took his course load in Spanish despite a sketchy-at-best vocabulary consisting of “Hola” and “Cerveza” accompanied by a total lack of judgment. In other words, Jonas is not one to overestimate the scale of new challenges.",

      "Linnea was born on a cold winter’s day, during the start up of her parents’ company. Thus, she early developed an entrepreneurial mindset that made her realize that business was her call in life. Already at the age of six, she sold delicious home made waffles to hungry hikers in her neighborhood every Sunday. Further on, she had a go at the media industry as a freelance photographer and journalist, until she studied for a bachelors degree in Business Administration at BI Norwegian Business School. The time she spent outside the lectures and study halls, she used to gain leadership experience as the CEO of the volunteer student organization Studentmediene i Trondheim and start her first company. The company sold socks produced in China to money-hungry Norwegian russ. In 2017, she moved on to launch her own retro ski apperal brand named Snowroller. Besides working on her many projects, Linnea also loves to travel the world, exercise and try out new recipes. This year, Linnea looks forward to gain knowledge, resources and connections at NTNU School of Entrepreneurship, to take Snowroller to the next level.",

Her fascination with the unknown laid the foundation for her studies, graduating with a bachelor in Social Anthropology in 2015 from the University in Tromsø. During the obtainment of her degree, she dreamt of how anthropology could become more sexy and practical as a subject. She decided that this would have to be someone else’s task, and therefore decided to attend NSE instead. At NSE Marthe practices unofficial fieldwork on innovation communities, with herself as the main test subject. She is passionate about working on projects that can solve social issues. In addition, Marthe enjoys surfing, everything that has to do with Northern Norway, eating other people’s garbage and to have a good cry with friends.",

While in Helsinki, she also acted as head of events and business cooperations for the METKA student union.\n\nDuring an internship at SBM Offshore in Monaco, she focused on supporting women in the male-dominated energy industry. Her thesis, centered on this cause, was accompanied by organising empowering events that brought women together to connect and realise their strength. A dedicated feminist with a drive to uplift minorities, Alina then has pursued double master's degrees in innovation management and sustainability at TU Berlin. Now, she is finishing her studies at NTNU Trondheim, focusing her thesis on AI and entrepreneurship.",

      "«It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste much of it. Life is long enough, and it has been given in sufficiently generous measure to allow the accomplishment of the very greatest things, if the whole of it is well invested” – Lucius Annaeus Seneca\n\nA little boy was born to a little family in the tiny village of Oslo back in the days of old. Little Theodor, an infinitely curious child, wanted answers to all that could not be answered. As the boy moved and grew up in the southernmost part of the land, in the revered kings port of Arendal, his curiosity knew no bounds. His teachers grew tired of his yapping, his family consulted the gods for answers, even the two family cats could do nothing but stand by and eat their tuna fish in perplexed silence. \n\nHaving exhausted everyone he knew, he had no choice but to continue his efforts in the far, far north. Now a young man, he had heard rumours that the scholars at the College of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology might have the answers to all the questions in the known universe. But the scholars at the faculty of Psychology too, were quickly overburdened by this intrepid curiosity, and they banished him to Italy with nothing but a full European insurance and an Erasmus Scholarship. Here the boy was cultured, he was lectured, and he was formed, through trial by fire in the flames of Coronavirus and great turmoil. But what does not kill, only strengthens the will.\n\nThe time is nigh for the return of the thing. He has come back, more hell bent than ever, to search for answers, and finish what was started! At the School of Entrepreneurship, will he finally meet his match?\n",

She is a little neurotically focused on giving her maximum effort in all areas of life — whether that is eating the most ice cream on May 17th, taking the fastest showers in her studentresidens, or being highly resultoriented in her studies. Alisha lives by the drive to always do her very best.\n\nEmpathy and care are central to Alisha’s character. She finds deep meaning and fulfillment in helping others and knowing she is making a difference in their lives. In her spare time, she is passionate about interior architecture and plants, constantly coming up with new ideas to decorate and design her appartment.

      'Isak hails from the picturesque island of Tromøya, just outside the city of Arendal in Southern Norway. Growing up in an outdoor-loving family with two younger brothers, he developed a deep passion for nature early on. After a binge of Lars Monsen’s films and books, 13-year-old Isak decided he would hike across Norway through the wilderness. He told his friends and family that by the summer he turned 16, he would be gone, and they should start preparing for it now because that was how it was going to be.\n\nFinding someone to join him on this expedition proved challenging, but one day in middle school, he asked another outdoor enthusiast whom he felt was the right fit, and to Isak\'s surprise, his friend quickly agreed. According to plan, Isak spent all three summers during high school trekking across Norway, becoming one of the youngest people to do so. He and his friend also filmed the TV series ""Villmark Uten Voksne"" (Wilderness Without Adults) for TV2 during their adventure. The series was even nominated for the Gullruten award for “Beste Nyskapning” in 2019. The expedition Isak started planning at 13 was completed five years later when he was 18. Safe to say, Isak is someone who thinks long-term and finishes what he starts.\n\nSince beginning his integrated master\'s degree in engineering at NTNU, his interest in technology has grown rapidly. Isak has been involved in various technical projects and part-time jobs alongside his studies (sometimes too many at once). Already in his fourth year, Isak has been involved in the space industry for nearly three years, taking on leadership roles in a satellite project with Orbit NTNU, working part-time and during the summer at KSAT, and even launching his own space startup. He\'s also a health fanatic, working out every day at 6:00 AM, with a drive that few can match. Now, his insatiable thirst for adventure has led him to his next chapter: launching exciting companies to solve important problems in the world, while also creating a tomorrow everyone can look forward to waking up to. This journey has brought him to ES. Business never sleeps.',

He played football at a young age, and at 16 years old, he wanted a six-pack, so he started lifting weights. Six years later, he’s lifting an astounding 160 kg on the bench press! This strength was an extremely useful skill when he worked as an industrial mechanic at a shipyard where he built boats for four years before going to study. If you think he has reached the top, you haven’t heard the half of it yet. When he started studying, he was elected as a leader for his student association, Elektra, and continued to grow. He was a significant part of student volunteer work, where he worked at Studenter Samfundet, Studenttinget, Velferdstinget as the leader of FØK. His friends would describe him like this: “Speleman is a man of many words, even though he can’t write any of them due to his dyslexia.” Even though dyslexia made it hard at times, his small bald head was brimming with knowledge in the weirdest subjects, which helped him a lot. These days, you can see him running marathons, lifting weights, painting, dancing in shows while bringing smiles to people’s faces, especially when he throws girls around in a show. As you can probably tell, this man never sits still and always has a huge smile and a lot of energy. After many experiences with teams and finishing his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering with robotics and automation, he was accepted to NES.

He loves nutrition and physical and psychological health. If he can improve this and make a living, he will enjoy the rest of his life as a happy father of 2-3 in the north of Norway. He will probably enjoy his life if he just makes a living actually, but he likes to shoot for the stars,and settle for the moon, and you can always find the moon on the top of his head!

He has previously worked within three startups, had internships at PwC and Elvia, and has been an analyst for Protector Forsikring ASA. Here he has gained a big variety of experience but found the spark in entrepreneurship. Alongside work, he took a bachelor’s degree in economics and was a project manager at Start NTNU. The project included creating a 3-day accelerator program, and the aim was to get students to start their own companies and to see opportunities within an entrepreneurial future. After finishing school, Eirik started paratroopers (Fallskjermjeger) admission into the army. Here he suffered a back injury, such that he was unable to continue. He learned here that no matter how hard you work, there will always be randomness involved, so it’s about constantly keeping irons in the fire. There are small differences that separate those who fail and those who succeed, and it is therefore important to never give up, but also not to be afraid to try, again and again. NTNU’s School of Entrepreneurship is the place Eirik was always meant to be. To seek out the solutions of tomorrow is what he lives for, and to always evolve is what he stands for. “If you look back one year and don’t think: «God, I was stupid back then», you have not had a successful year.”",

He grew up in Oslo and quickly realized he wanted to make a dent in the world with an attitude that can be summed up in his own young words: “can try, can try”. Shortly after, at the age of 6, he figured out that jumping bikes in the woods were fun too. At the age of 14, Thomas started racing downhill mountain bikes and at 17, Thomas moved to Lillehammer to take his last year at high school at NTG. This formed Thomas’ values as a top athlete. This helped Thomas rank 2nd overall in the Norwegian enduro series and become a brand ambassador for Norrøna. After some hard crashes, Thomas realized during the 2019 season that the reward of competing wasn’t worth the risk. During his 9 years of racing bikes, Thomas’ real goal had become fuzzy. Thomas completed his master’s degree in mechanical engineering in 2021, but it did not feel right for him to go straight out in work life, as engineering always was a plan b. Thomas instead took a year off to figure out what he wanted to do. He quickly felt the pull towards entrepreneurship and learning, and after getting a long-lasting concussion while surfing, Thomas started developing a watersports helmet.Thomas loves being outdoors or traveling in his homemade campervan, pursuing one of his now many activities including surfing, backcountry skiing, wing foiling, guitar, kiteboarding, and of course mountain biking. His driven personality shines through in these activities as he performs them at a high level or is in the process of doing so. In contrast to engineering, Thomas sees entrepreneurship as one of the activities he wants to master and he is now in the process of doing so.",

He wrote his second application from a bungalow in Thailand, and it turned out to be the winning ticket, securing his place at ES. Now, he stands ready to take on the world with his next startup venture. Herman would never have referred to himself in the third person. Business never sleeps.",

      "In the sunny region of Norway just outside the capital, you’ll find Nesodden, the pearl of the Oslo Fjord, where Jonatan grew up. Yes, you read it correctly, Jonatan without a ‘H.’ Seriously what’s the point of a ‘H’? Either way. In 2006, after two weeks of school, Jonatan believed he had already learned everything and wanted to quit school. Little did this stubborn young man know that he had many, many years ahead of him. Jonatan became fascinated with business development at an early age and has actively made educational choices since middle school to become the best possible entrepreneur. In 2019, Jonatan moved away from the sun to wind and rain, to a city called Ålesund, for a bachelor’s degree in Biomarine innovation at NTNU. He views this as an exciting field filled with opportunities. His fascination with the ocean stems from diving, a hobby he has cherished for a long time. In the 5th semester, Jonatan felt the need for some sun again and set his sails to Hawaii, where he had a legendary exchange semester. After completing his bachelor’s degree, Jonatan headed to Trondheim, another rainy city, where he pursued his passion for watches and started working as a salesman at Urmaker Lian. Now, The Norwegian School of Entrepreneurship is precisely the right place for Jonatan to pursue his dream of establishing a successful business. With a touch of competitiveness, a healthy dose of determination, and sky-high ambitions, Jonatan will strive to achieve his goals. As stated in his interview:JS + ES = GS Business never sleeps.",

      "Meet Julie, the unstoppable force of nature with a knack for turning energy conservation into a thrilling adventure. What truly sets Julie apart is her unshakable commitment to renewable energy and the environment, which made her pursue her Bachelor’s degree in Renewable Energy at NTNU. She’s not just an engineer; she’s a superhero engineer on a mission to save the planet, one kilowatt-hour at a time. Julie’s secret weapon? A never-ending supply of positivity and an infectious enthusiasm that’ll power any team through the toughest challenges. During her studies she took on voluntary roles all three years, with positions as head of welcome week, chair of the board, and web developer, she really got to challenge herself and develop new tools in her skill set. Julie’s not your average 24-year-old from Bodø. Being a true Northern Norwegian, Julie speaks straight from the liver as we say in Norway. She’s the life of the party on the alpine slopes, a social butterfly, and a hiking aficionado. When she’s not taking the world of energy efficiency by storm, she is honing her super sales powers – she really is able to sell sand in the Sahara desert. In the summer of 2023, she donned her superhero cape as a summer intern at Multiconsult, boldly venturing into the realm of energy and cost-saving opportunities within the aquaculture sector. In 2022, she proved that even kilowatt-hours can’t escape her inquisitive gaze while working at Kjeldsberg Eiendomsforvaltning AS. Fun fact, Julie excelled in cheerleading where her team became Norwegian Champions in 2015. Business never sleeps.",
